## Today

Cool! Today we're going to:

* Learn about self
* Learn the difference between class methods and instance methods
* Try to model relationships between objects (using trainers and pokemon)

* Practice writing classes - A pokemon trainer
  * What can a trainer do?
  * How can we tell two trainers apart? What if they have the same data?
  * How do we `require` both classes so we can use them together?
  * What relationships do trainers have to our other classes?

* Who is in charge of knowing about the relationship between a trainer and a pokemon?

* How should pokemon be related to trainers?
  * We probably need a class variable for this!
  * What do we do if there are two trainers with the same name?
  * How can we tell them apart or make them unique?
