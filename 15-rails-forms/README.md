## Rails Forms

Forms and MVC:

Forms are at the heart of MVC!
  * The inputs you need for the form are based on the data stored by the model.
  * The form itself is a view.
  * The input 'name's determine the structure of params in the controller.
  * The "path" and "action" of the form should match the route of whatever processes the form!

Reminder:

Rails, like ActiveRecord before it, has a jillion methods.
You'll memorize the stuff you use a lot but also spend
plenty of time googling for the syntax of a particular method.

Knowing all the methods isn't important. Having an idea of how to find docs is.

Objectives:

* raw form vs form_tag vs form_for/form_with
* path_helpers / link_to vs an a tag
* see edit/update
* talk strong params/mass assignment

Probably won't get to:

* template partials / layouts
